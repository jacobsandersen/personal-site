Hello!

This website is part of the IndieWeb: https://indieweb.org/.

If you're here, you're either a bot yourself or you noticed my website visiting yours.

If I like, reply to, or otherwise reference your content, I create a post that links to it. My website will visit your website to check the content
so I can render it locally.

If you do not want me to do this, please add my user agent to your robots.txt and disallow it. That's the first thing I check! And, my apologies.

Otherwise, I'm harmless - just grabbing a snapshot for my own UI.

Best,
Jacob
